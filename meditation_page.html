	<h3>easy difficulty</h3>
    <p>in this mode we make no effort to restrict movement of the mind. spend the time thinking about whatever you like.</p>
    <p>this may not qualify as meditation in a classical sense but it's very healthy for me because I so rarely give my mind unstructured time. (usually I'm on my phone or something.)</p>
	<p>this is a chance for plans and ideas in the back of my mind to surface and receive some attention. I may even be inspired to write down some notes or set a reminder for later; this is fine and good to do.</p>
    </div>
	
	<div class="entry">
    <h3>normal difficulty</h3>
    <p>now we're getting into some "real" meditation</p>
	<p>the idea here, as I understand it, is to introduce some space between the mind and the self.</p>
	<p>it's MY mind, it's a part of me, but I don't have to immediately do whatever it wants, immediately believe whatever it says.</p>
	<p>picture Huesos picking up his toy and pushing it against you. he wants to play tug of war, but what if you don't want to play right now? do you have to play anyway, or can you just chill for a second?</p>
	<p>this will of course take practice!</p>
